    Summer is my favorite season. I get a break from school, in which I can explore new things that I am interested in by going to different camps, and I get to go on vacation! Furthermore, I can hang out with my friends, and go swimming. I also get to enjoy the warm weather. It is especially great in Georgia because it never gets too hot! I love that summer is in between Spring and Fall because at the beginning of Summer, there are still flowers blossoming from Spring, and towards the end, there are leaves that are turning colors.
